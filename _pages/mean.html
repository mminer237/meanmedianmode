	<p>A mean is what we typically think of as an "average." It's the number whose value is in the center of the given values.</p>
	<p>A mean is found by adding up all the numbers and then dividing the sum by the number of numbers:</p>
	<math>
		<mfrac>
			<mrow>
				<msub>
					<mi>x</mi>
					<mn>1</mn>
				</msub>
				<mo>+</mo>
				<msub>
					<mi>x</mi>
					<mn>2</mn>
				</msub>
				<mo>+</mo>
				<mo>â€¦</mo>
				<mo>+</mo>
				<msub>
					<mi>x</mi>
					<mi>n</mi>
				</msub>
			</mrow>
			<mi>n</mi>
		</mfrac>
	</math>
	<p>For example, if you have the numbers "2, 3, 7", you would add them together to get 12, and then divide by 3 to get 4:</p>
	<math>
		<mfrac>
			<mrow>
				<mn>2</mn>
				<mo>+</mo>
				<mn>3</mn>
				<mo>+</mo>
				<mn>7</mn>
			</mrow>
			<mn>3</mn>
		</mfrac>
		<mo>=</mo>
		<mfrac>
			<mn>12</mn>
			<mn>3</mn>
		</mfrac>
		<mo>=</mo>
		<mn>4</mn>
	</math>
	<p>Means are very useful, especially when you are looking to forecast something where outliers will be averaged out and not matter individually.</p>
	<p>For example, if you get $200 per day during the weekdays, and $0 per day on the weekends, you can average these out and know that you can spend an average of $71.42 per day. It doesn't matter that you don't earn money on the weekends because the money from the weekdays exceeding the average will balance them out.</p>
